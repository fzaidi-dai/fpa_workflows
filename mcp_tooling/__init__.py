FPA MCP Tools Package

This package provides generic tools for connecting to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
and creating tools that can be used with Google ADK agents.

Note: This package is named 'fpa_mcp_tools' to avoid conflicts with the external 'mcp' package
that the Google ADK library expects to import 'ClientSession' from.
