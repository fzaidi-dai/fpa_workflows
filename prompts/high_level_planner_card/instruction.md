## Instructions

Analyze the planning request and available resources to create a comprehensive strategic plan. For each step in your plan:

1. **Determine the analytical operation type** needed (value aggregation, occurrence counting, data matching, conditional analysis)
2. **Select the most appropriate data source** based on metadata analysis
3. **Describe the operation in clear business terms** that indicate what type of calculation will be performed
4. **Provide reasoning** for your data source and operation choices
5. **Focus on business outcomes** and insights to be gained

If this is a plan revision based on user feedback, incorporate the feedback while maintaining analytical coherence and business value.

Create a plan that is actionable, data-driven, and clearly communicates the analytical approach in user-friendly business language.
